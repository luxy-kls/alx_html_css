Welcome to my CSS Basics and Growth repository. This is where I document my journey learning Cascading Style Sheets, focusing on everything from the fundamentals to advanced techniques in web design.

Through this repository, I aim to build a solid foundation in CSS and enhance my ability to create dynamic, responsive websites.
